<!-- ## Overview

The National Ignition Facility (NIF) is home to the largest and most powerful laser in the world. The Power Conditioning System (PCS), which contains an array of 4000 capacitors, supplies the electrical energy to the laser amplifiers. Failure of one of these capacitors results in a loss of one 1.8MJ PCS module and causes delays in NIF’s research while repairs are made. This sensor is part of an array of tools used to analyze and track the health of the PCS capacitors.

The National Ignition Facility uses 4000 capacitors installed in 192 PCS modules to provide up to 400MJ of electrical energy to the laser amplifiers.

These capacitors are discharged through 100 miles of coaxial cables into 7680 flashlamps, providing gain to the laser.

NIF has experienced 4 capacitor failures in the last 8 years…
…resulting in programmatic delays while the repairs are done.


NIF takes great effort to avoid capacitor failures. The Capscan sensor will be one of the tools used to monitor the capacitor banks.

## Failure Detection Methods

The Main Energy Storage Module (MESM) is a complicated circuit consisting of 20 capacitors and damping elements. It can be approximated as an RLC circuit with parasitics.

Changes in capacitance indicate a failing capacitor.

The circuit resonates at approximately 3 kHz. To determine the exact resonant frequency, the Capscan sensor sends a series of AC frequency sweeps through the MESM while monitoring the output current and voltage at each frequency. Using the equation

the capacitance of an individual capacitor in a PCS module can be determined without performing a time-consuming capacitor disconnect procedure. If the capacitance deviates from acceptable values, it will be replaced.


## CAPSCAN Sensor

By tracking changes in capacitance, NIF operators can detect impending capacitor failure. Due to their internal arrangement, NIF capacitors generally lose capacitance in increments of 10 uF.

CAPSCAN operates by sending a frequency sweep into a NIF capacitor, and uses the resonant peak to determine capacitance.


Replace the previous-generation Capscan sensor, which was restricted to low signal levels, slow, difficult to operate, and made inconsistent measurements due to parasitic elements.

Develop a computer application that enables engineers to analyze and track the capacitance of each capacitor over time, allowing degraded capacitors to be removed from service before they fail.

Deploy the next-generation sensor to each of the 4 NIF capacitor bays. -->
