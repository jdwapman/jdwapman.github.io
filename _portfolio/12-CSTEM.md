The [UC Davis C-STEM Center](https://c-stem.ucdavis.edu/)'s primary goal is to expand STEM opportunities in K-12 education. I worked in the C-STEM Center under Dr. Harry Cheng during Winter and Spring of 2016. While there, my projects included developing open-access robotics and programming learning materials for middle-school level students, writing sample codes for the [Linkbot](https://www.barobo.com/linkbot) robotics platform, and assisting with organizing and running the C-STEM center's yearly RoboPlay competition hosted at UC Davis.
