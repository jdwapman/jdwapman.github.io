During the Spring of 2018 I spent a summer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory researching [Collaborative Autonomy for UAV Swarms](https://www.llnl.gov/news/laboratory-researchers-join-their-ai-enabled-counterparts-collaborative-autonomy)

My research focused on distributed detection algorithms applied to chemical plume detection. This included evaluations of several detection algorithms, distributed communication methods, and strategies to improve detection rates by using the swarm to explore its environment.

I presented a [poster](/files/llnl_ced/LLNL_CASIS_Poster.pdf) at LLNL's 2018 Signal and Image Sciences Workshop.
