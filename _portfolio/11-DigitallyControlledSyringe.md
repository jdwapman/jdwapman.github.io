As the Electrical Engineer on the team, I first started by creating an interface between the Arduino and a 4-phase stepper motor using an A4988 Stepper Motor Driver.

The next step was to create a user interface for the Arduino, allowing the user to configure parameters such as the liquid density, desired flow rate, and desired run time.
