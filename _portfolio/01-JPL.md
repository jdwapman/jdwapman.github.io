During Summer 2019 I worked as an intern in the Guidance & Control group at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA.

CubeSats are small, relatively cheap satellites that have been successfully used for gathering climate data, imaging distance galaxies, and most recently for relaying telemetry data from the InSight Lander's landing on Mars.
