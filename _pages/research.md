## DARPA Software-Define Hardware

[DARPA Press Release](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2018-07-24a)  
[Nvidia Press Release](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/07/24/darpa-research-post-moores-law/)  

More information coming soon.

## Gunrock

I implemented the [Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HITS_algorithm) (HITS) web page ranking algorithm in [Gunrock](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock/tree/master/gunrock/app/hits).    

The goal of the HITS algorithm is to assign websites with a hub score an authority score. Websites with high hub scores are sites that are useful as search engines (example: Google), while sites with high authority scores are websites that contain authoritative information (example: Wikipedia). More specifically, sites that point to other websites with high authority scores have a high hub score, and websites pointed to by other sites with high hub scores in turn have a high authority score.

Other contributions include general Gunrock documentation, bug fixes, and tests.

## Past Projects

Past research projects include:
* Design and characterization of a planar air-bearing platform used for CubeSat guidance & control tests at NASA JPL [(Link)](/portfolio/01-JPL)
* Simulation of distributed detection algorithms applied to chemical plume detection using autonomous robotic swarms at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [(Link)](/portfolio/02-llnl_swarm)
* Design of a low-cost data capture system for fluorescence lifetime spectroscopy with [Professor Diego Yankelevich](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/yankelevich/) and [Professor Laura Marcu](https://marculab.bme.ucdavis.edu/) at UC Davis [(Link)](/portfolio/05-yankelevich)
