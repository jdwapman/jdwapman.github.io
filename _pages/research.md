# DARPA Software-Define Hardware

# Gunrock

I implemented the [Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HITS_algorithm) (HITS) web page ranking algorithm in [Gunrock](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock/tree/master/gunrock/app/hits).    

The goal of the HITS algorithm is to assign websites with a hub score an an authority score. Websites with high hub scores are sites that are useful as search engines (example: Google), while sites with high authority scores are websites that contain authoritative information (example: Wikipedia). More specifically, sites that point to other websites with high authority scores have a high hub score, and websites pointed to by other sites with high hub scores in turn have a high authority score.

# Past Projects

Past research projects include:
