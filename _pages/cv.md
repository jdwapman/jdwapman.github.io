## NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
Guidance & Control Intern  
June 2018 - September 2018
* Developed control algorithms and software drivers to enable automated position and attitude control of a planar air-bearing platform using used for CubeSat formation flying, pointing, and rendezvous experiments.
* Planned and executed a series of laboratory tests to fully characterize the planar platform’s physical properties, software performance, and position-control capabilities. Extensive data analysis performed using MATLAB.


## Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
Computational Engineering Intern  
March 2018 - June 2018
* Modeled and simulated decentralized multi-agent robotic swarm algorithms for signal detection, information
exchange, and motion planning applied to chemical plume identification and localization.  

Engineering Intern  
June 2017 - September 2017  
* Created a sensor and LabView virtual instrument used to measure and track the capacitance of over 4000 high energy-density capacitors for preventative maintenance. Achieved  accuracy within 3% and repeatability within 1%.


## Yankelevich & Marcu Laboratory
Undergraduate Research Assistant
January 2017 - March 2018

## Silva Laboratory
Undergraduate Research Assistant  
September 2016 - June 2017  
* Designed circuitry and programmed an Arduino for a digitally-controlled syringe with a team of three students. Used as a low-cost alternative for microfluidic educational and research projects.


## Varian Medical Systems
Engineering Intern  
June 2016 - September 2016
* Designed PCBs and software used to validate Multi-Leaved Collimator motors for radiation therapy machines.
* Programmed a GUI-based application to allow engineers to interface with MLC motor test equipment. Features include telemetry data visualizations, command sequence entry, and debugging tools.


## UC Davis C-STEM Center
Research Assistant  
January 2016 - June 2016
* Developed code examples for Arduino robotic platforms such as line-following and maze-solving procedures.
* Created teaching materials for middle-school students to learn basic coding and robotics concepts.


## White Laboratory
Undergraduate Research Assistant  
December 2016  
* Created scale models of LA buildings using foam blocks for use in wind tunnel simulations.
