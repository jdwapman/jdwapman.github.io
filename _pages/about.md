I am a PhD student at UC Davis studying Electrical and Computer Engineering  under [Professor John Owens](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/research.html). My research interests include parallel algorithms and architectures used in Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), graph algorithms, sparse linear algebra, and machine learning. I also enjoy working with autonomous systems and robotics - both on land and in space.


My current research focuses on the intersection of load balancing and locality for sparse linear algebra and graph analytics. I am currently working with NVIDIA on DARPAâ€™s Software-Defined Hardware program, where my interests are on the unique benefits of reconfigurable hardware for sparse computations, the relationships between load balancing and data locality, and explicit data orchestration programming models for sparse workloads both on reconfigurable hardware and traditional GPUs. See press releases from [Nvidia](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/07/24/darpa-research-post-moores-law/) and [DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2018-07-24a) for more information.

I am a contributor to [Gunrock](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock), an open-source, GPU-accelerated graph analytics library. My Gunrock implementation of the Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm is used in NVIDIA's [RAPIDS cuGraph](https://github.com/rapidsai/cugraph) open-source data analytics library.

My Github, including the source code for this website, is available [here](https://github.com/jdwapman).

In my free time, I enjoy [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jwapmanphotography/albums/72157710296974147), hiking, and rock climbing.
