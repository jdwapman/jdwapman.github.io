I am currently a Master's student at UC Davis studying Electrical and Computer Engineering  under [Dr. John Owens](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/research.html). My research interests include parallel algorithms and architectures used in Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), graph analytics, and machine learning. I also enjoy working with autonomous systems and robotics - both on land and in space.

<!-- My current research focuses methods of mapping parallel graph algorithms and load-balancing strategies to a novel reconfigurable GPU architecture as part of DARPA's Software-Defined Hardware program. See press releases from [Nvidia](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/07/24/darpa-research-post-moores-law/) and [DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2018-07-24a) for more information. -->

I am a contributor to [Gunrock](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock), an open-source, GPU-accelerated graph analytics library.

You can contact me at jdwapman [at] ucdavis [dot] edu or by messaging me on LinkedIn.

In my free time, I enjoy photography, hiking, and rock climbing.
