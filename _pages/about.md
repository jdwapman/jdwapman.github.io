I am currently a graduate student at UC Davis studying Electrical and Computer Engineering  under [Dr. John Owens](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/research.html).

I am currently researching methods of mapping parallel graph algorithms and load-balancing strategies to a novel reconfigurable GPU architecture as part of DARPA's Software-Defined Hardware program. See press releases from [Nvidia](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/07/24/darpa-research-post-moores-law/) and [DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2018-07-24a) for more information.

I am a contributor to [Gunrock](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock), an open-source, GPU-accelerated graph analytics library.

In my free time, I enjoy [photography](/photography/), hiking, and rock climbing.
